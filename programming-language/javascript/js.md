# General JavaScript Coding Standards

## Code Practices

- Use `const` for variables that won't be reassigned; use `let` for variables that will.
- Prefer arrow functions (`=>`) for concise function expressions.
- Use template literals (`` ` ``) for string interpolation.
- Use strict equality (`===`) for comparisons.
- Avoid global variables; use modules for encapsulation.
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) over CommonJS.
- Follow `camelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

---

## Error Handling

- Use `try/catch` for synchronous error handling.
- Handle promise rejections with `.catch()` or `try/catch` in `async` functions.
- Throw custom errors with meaningful messages.
- Validate inputs to prevent runtime errors.

---

## Dependency Management

- Use `npm` or `Yarn` for package management.
- Pin dependency versions in `package.json`.
- Group dependencies by purpose (e.g., production, dev, optional).

---

## Code Organization

- Organize code into modules by feature or responsibility.
- Use a consistent folder structure (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `utils/`).
- Keep configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `package.json`) at the project root.

---

## Logging

- Use `console.log` for debugging; remove or suppress in production.
- Use a logging library (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) for structured logging.
- Log errors with sufficient context (e.g., stack trace, input data).

---

## Testing

- Write unit tests for core logic using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
- Write integration tests for critical paths.
- Use mocking libraries (e.g., Jest, Sinon) for dependencies.
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%).

---

## Documentation

- Use JSDoc for function and module documentation.
- Maintain a `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
- Document complex logic with inline comments.

---

## Security

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Avoid `eval()` and similar unsafe functions.
- Use HTTPS for network requests.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable.

---

## Performance

- Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations.
- Use debouncing or throttling for event handlers.
- Optimize loops and recursive functions.
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking and code splitting.
